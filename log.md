# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS on my first project, a wedding website for my fiancee and I. Modified the navbar alignment and added a dropshadow to thumbnail images.  I also proofed the body copy, correcting any spelling or grammatical errors. I also continued working on my portfolio site for freeCodeCamp, which I am hoping to launch as soon as I can get the case studies written for my portfolio pieces.

**Thoughts:** I still want to add some Javascript to make the page more dynamic, but am happy with how minimal the site is. I will have to add real links in the Registry section after we have completed those tasks, as well as adding transportation information.

### Day 1: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on simplifying some of the CSS on my portfolio website since I don't fully understand how to use Flexbox yet. Will continue to try and learn it, though, as it appears to be valuable. I also started General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course today, so I created a couple of basic HTML and CSS pages to brush up on those skills.

**Thoughts:** I may take one of the basic pages concerning a cookie recipe and transform that into a creative side project. Should be a fun subject to experiment with Javascript and design on. We shall see. I also need to fix the social links in the footer of my portfolio page.

### Day 2: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about flexbox and trying to teach myself how to improve the CSS on my portfolio website. A fellow Twitter user suggested that I check out flexbox froggy in order to learn the mechanics.

**Thoughts:** Though I didn't do much actual coding today, I am committed to finishing this flexbox tutorial. I'll need to sit down for an hour or two over the next two days to finish it.

### Day 3: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today in FEWD30 we reviewed CSS basics and worked on creating portfolio pages for ourselves. I already have another portfolio website in the works, but I think that building one without bootstrap and flexbox will prove useful to my fundamental knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I will need to put together the actual portfolio section of the site tomorrow, and connect it with the About Me section. I'll try to find some more creative ways to style the content as well.

### Day 4: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Altered the links in the wedding portfolio site to open to our newly created registries, as well as open in new tabs. I mainly focused on alterations to the portfolio site that I've been building from scratch. I've decided to take inspiration from Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and brand my services akin to a cereal.

**Thoughts:** Building a parralax style page for my portfolio, modeled after a cereal marketing scheme, is fun and challenging so far. There are some uneven lines on the page that I'd like to recreate, as well as figuring out how to create my own grid system or get the divs to sit side by side and still be responsive. Another day, another thing to learn :)

### Day 5: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the portfolio. Specifically, am trying to figure out how I can get a banner image in the header with text overlaying it to behave nicely when adjusting to different screen sizes.

**Thoughts:** I'll have to check out the Codecademy responsiveness project I worked on a few months ago, as I believe that had a similiar images with text overlays that I may wish to copy. I'm still having trouble deciding on whether it should be a full width image at desktop sizes, or the if the image should be floating to the left. Going to try and commit to learning flexbox tomorrow, work allowing.

### Day 6: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the portfolio. Settled on the banner image and text floating for now. Also added in pictures for my experiences section and continued playing around with the box model. Will be reviewing that further during FEWD30 at GA tonight.

**Thoughts:** Still gotta finish this flexbox tutorial and get started on the JS for freeCodeCamp. Maybe later.

### Day 7: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating the Relaxr single column home page according to the provided PSD.

**Thoughts:** Interesting exercise for the CSS box model. Will need to consult with the teacher or perform additional research in order to better match the styles from the PSD.

### Day 8: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued experimenting with the CSS box model, divs, and classes. I also updated the links on the Things to Do page of the wedding website. Also, I started freeCodeCamps Javascript lessons. Also updated the Relaxr website.

**Thoughts:** Still need to write case studies for my portfolio. I think I may add some interactivity to the wedding site with JS or jQuery if I can find anywhere useful for it. I will have to pick Eloquent Javascript back up soon. Homework is to finish the Relaxr landing page.

### Day 9: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on completing the Relaxr site. Added a larger bottom margin to the top container to accommodate smaller screen sizes. Also started reading a 2017 guide to Front-End development.

**Thoughts:** Gonna try to knock out reading this guide, but am going to continue doing freeCodeCamp JS lessons tomorrow. May also try to write the case studies for my portfolio, time permitting.
