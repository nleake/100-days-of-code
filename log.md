# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS on my first project, a wedding website for my fiancee and I. Modified the navbar alignment and added a dropshadow to thumbnail images.  I also proofed the body copy, correcting any spelling or grammatical errors. I also continued working on my portfolio site for freeCodeCamp, which I am hoping to launch as soon as I can get the case studies written for my portfolio pieces.

**Thoughts:** I still want to add some Javascript to make the page more dynamic, but am happy with how minimal the site is. I will have to add real links in the Registry section after we have completed those tasks, as well as adding transportation information.

### Day 1: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on simplifying some of the CSS on my portfolio website since I don't fully understand how to use Flexbox yet. Will continue to try and learn it, though, as it appears to be valuable. I also started General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course today, so I created a couple of basic HTML and CSS pages to brush up on those skills. 

**Thoughts:** I may take one of the basic pages concerning a cookie recipe and transform that into a creative side project. Should be a fun subject to experiment with Javascript and design on. We shall see. I also need to fix the social links in the footer of my portfolio page.

### Day 2: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about flexbox and trying to teach myself how to improve the CSS on my portfolio website. A fellow Twitter user suggested that I check out flexbox froggy in order to learn the mechanics.

**Thoughts:** Though I didn't do much actual coding today, I am committed to finishing this flexbox tutorial. I'll need to sit down for an hour or two over the next two days to finish it.

### Day 2: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today in FEWD30 we reviewed CSS basics and worked on creating portfolio pages for ourselves. I already have another portfolio website in the works, but I think that building one without bootstrap and flexbox will prove useful to my fundamental knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I will need to put together the actual portfolio section of the site tomorrow, and connect it with the About Me section. I'll try to find some more creative ways to style the content as well.
