# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS on my first project, a wedding website for my fiancee and I. Modified the navbar alignment and added a dropshadow to thumbnail images.  I also proofed the body copy, correcting any spelling or grammatical errors. I also continued working on my portfolio site for freeCodeCamp, which I am hoping to launch as soon as I can get the case studies written for my portfolio pieces.

**Thoughts:** I still want to add some Javascript to make the page more dynamic, but am happy with how minimal the site is. I will have to add real links in the Registry section after we have completed those tasks, as well as adding transportation information.

### Day 1: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on simplifying some of the CSS on my portfolio website since I don't fully understand how to use Flexbox yet. Will continue to try and learn it, though, as it appears to be valuable. I also started General Assembly's Front-End Web Development course today, so I created a couple of basic HTML and CSS pages to brush up on those skills.

**Thoughts:** I may take one of the basic pages concerning a cookie recipe and transform that into a creative side project. Should be a fun subject to experiment with Javascript and design on. We shall see. I also need to fix the social links in the footer of my portfolio page.

### Day 2: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about flexbox and trying to teach myself how to improve the CSS on my portfolio website. A fellow Twitter user suggested that I check out flexbox froggy in order to learn the mechanics.

**Thoughts:** Though I didn't do much actual coding today, I am committed to finishing this flexbox tutorial. I'll need to sit down for an hour or two over the next two days to finish it.

### Day 3: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today in FEWD30 we reviewed CSS basics and worked on creating portfolio pages for ourselves. I already have another portfolio website in the works, but I think that building one without bootstrap and flexbox will prove useful to my fundamental knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I will need to put together the actual portfolio section of the site tomorrow, and connect it with the About Me section. I'll try to find some more creative ways to style the content as well.

### Day 4: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Altered the links in the wedding portfolio site to open to our newly created registries, as well as open in new tabs. I mainly focused on alterations to the portfolio site that I've been building from scratch. I've decided to take inspiration from Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and brand my services akin to a cereal.

**Thoughts:** Building a parralax style page for my portfolio, modeled after a cereal marketing scheme, is fun and challenging so far. There are some uneven lines on the page that I'd like to recreate, as well as figuring out how to create my own grid system or get the divs to sit side by side and still be responsive. Another day, another thing to learn :)

### Day 5: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the portfolio. Specifically, am trying to figure out how I can get a banner image in the header with text overlaying it to behave nicely when adjusting to different screen sizes.

**Thoughts:** I'll have to check out the Codecademy responsiveness project I worked on a few months ago, as I believe that had a similiar images with text overlays that I may wish to copy. I'm still having trouble deciding on whether it should be a full width image at desktop sizes, or the if the image should be floating to the left. Going to try and commit to learning flexbox tomorrow, work allowing.

### Day 6: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the portfolio. Settled on the banner image and text floating for now. Also added in pictures for my experiences section and continued playing around with the box model. Will be reviewing that further during FEWD30 at GA tonight.

**Thoughts:** Still gotta finish this flexbox tutorial and get started on the JS for freeCodeCamp. Maybe later.

### Day 7: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating the Relaxr single column home page according to the provided PSD.

**Thoughts:** Interesting exercise for the CSS box model. Will need to consult with the teacher or perform additional research in order to better match the styles from the PSD.

### Day 8: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued experimenting with the CSS box model, divs, and classes. I also updated the links on the Things to Do page of the wedding website. Also, I started freeCodeCamps Javascript lessons. Also updated the Relaxr website.

**Thoughts:** Still need to write case studies for my portfolio. I think I may add some interactivity to the wedding site with JS or jQuery if I can find anywhere useful for it. I will have to pick Eloquent Javascript back up soon. Homework is to finish the Relaxr landing page.

### Day 9: February 3, 2017

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Today's Progress**: Worked on completing the Relaxr site. Added a larger bottom margin to the top container to accommodate smaller screen sizes. Also started reading a 2017 guide to Front-End development.

**Thoughts:** Gonna try to knock out reading this guide, but am going to continue doing freeCodeCamp JS lessons tomorrow. May also try to write the case studies for my portfolio, time permitting.

### Day 10: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Eloquent Javascript and continued working on the freeCodeCamp JS tutorials. Cleaned up the background image for the Relaxr landing page and starting creating a prototype blogs page.

**Thoughts:** Going to continue focusing on learning JS. Learned about floats and clears today in FEWD30. Looking forward to learning flexbox afterwards as advances in grid systems seem to have made these CSS properties obsolete?

### Day 11: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Eloquent Javascript. I created a webpage with a more complex layout in FEWD30 today; the idea for the page is a website that helps people find developers and designers for their ideas. I am also working on a blog page for Relaxr.

**Thoughts:** Going to continue focusing on learning JS. Still looking forward to learning flexbox afterwards. Am also thinking that I will redesign my wedding website in order to reduce clutter and make things more readable.

### Day 12: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Eloquent Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Moving a bit slower than I would like. It's been a busy week, but in a good way. Just not for coding, I suppose. However, I will not be deterred! Going to sit down for some odd hours over the next few days and really try to crank this book out.

### Day 13: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing work on Eloquent JS. Also started intro to programming in FEWD class. Learned about event listeners and starting to manipulate the DOM using JS.

**Thoughts:** The class did a good job of easing folks into event listeners and getting us to start working with pseudo code. I also liked that we went over some troubleshooting use cases for console.log function.

### Day 14: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on learning jQuery and how to start moving around the DOM. We built a stoplight in class that's modified through jQuery.

**Thoughts:** jQuery seems okay, but I am far more interested in learning vanilla JavaScript. Going to continue working on Eloquent JS (functoins, recursions, and closures, yay!).

### Day 15: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my portfolio website and continued studying Javascript. I also watched a YouTube video concerning Hacking the Development Interview and realized how much more I have to learn. A bit intimidating, but, then again, there is always more to learn. Looking forward to continuing to learn JS!

**Thoughts:** bought the domain and hosting for my portfolio website, so that's one step closer to getting that up there. Going to edit the CSS and get the webform working so that people can email me. Then I can start using that for applications and referring people to my own personal site. Yay!

### Day 16: February 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the jQuery assignment for my FEWD class. I also built wireframes for a redesign of an application for my work contract.

**Thoughts:** The jQuery assignment was simpler than I thought. Going to try and continue to ready Eloquent JS and will hopefully learn more Javascript tomorrow. Have taken a couple days off from the holiday weekend, but will need to get back into doing this every day. I also need to get the HTML and CSS uploaded for my portfolio, finish the wireframes for that, and write the case studies.

**Link to work:** [FEWD-30](https://github.com/nleake/FEWD30)

### Day 17: February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built some different simple Javascript examples in FEWD class and uploaded those to GitHub. I also added the HTML and CSS for my portfolio site main screen.

**Thoughts:** TThe additional jQuery/Javascript exercises were helpful in building lite problem solving habits, using pseudo-code, and commenting our process/solutions. I need to set up the PHP for my web form and add . I also need to get those case studies written and build pages for them!

**Link to work:** [FEWD JS](https://github.com/nleake/FEWD30/tree/master/JS)


### Day 18: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a basic cash register application and an app for converting temperatures from fahrenheit inputs to celsius.

**Thoughts:** May flesh out the cash register and temperature conversion applications with more styles and functionality later.

### Day 19: February 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned some basics for Git and how to use the command line to manipulate files and directories

**Thoughts:** Using Bash is awesome. Going to continue to use this from now on.

**Link to work:** [Bash Practice](https://github.com/nleake/command-practice/master)

### Day 20: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I added some cool background switching logic to our temperature converter and continued practicing Bash and the command line.

**Thoughts:** Need to style the backgrounds and the text appropriately so that it looks good, but the logic is there.

### Day 21: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my portfolio site. Updated entries with descriptions and also added a meta description and Google Analytics to the site.

**Thoughts:** Going to continue completing Eloquent Javascript exercises. Still need to hook up the PHP to my form elements.

### Day 22: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a front-end bootcamp online at Udemy to supplement Eloquent JS and freeCodeCamp. So far it's really good and I'm going to get caught up to the Javascript portions that I'm working on with the other two resources. Today I practiced some table and form work from this Udemy course.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the Udemy course and the extra detail it's going into. Also realized today that I know next to nothing about .NET and C#

### Day 25: March 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished some homework for Lambda School mini bootcamp (npm install and running tests, yay!). I also created a cat landing page in Bootstrap and re-did some of my colors on the portfolio site. I also added some jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Will continue with Eloquent JavaScript. I've also reached the JavaScript portion of the Udemy course that I'm taking, so that's good. Feels nice to be in strictly JS learning territory on three separate fronts.

### Day 29: March 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on some CSS and jQuery animations. Also worked on the higher order functions chapter of Eloquent Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Need to practice with the reduce method more. Trying to rotate elements with jQuery is also more difficult than I had anticipated.

### Day 30: April 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the to-do list application in Colt Steele's Web Dev bootcamp. Started on an application using paper.js. Also did some intro work to SASS in FEWD-DC-30.

**Thoughts:** SASS is awesome. Looking forward to completing this Patatap clone project and starting to learn about backend development in the bootcamp :)

### Day 31: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FEWD-DC-30 class. Presented my portfolio project, which was awesome. Today I started learning Node.JS and Express. I built a couple of basic applications to practice routing and different get requests.

**Thoughts:** Express seems really cool. I'm looking forward to learning more about it. I also worked on a couple of algorithm challenges for freeCodeCamp. Shoutouts to Quincy Larson. Also, npm is sweet. Really digging all the command line practice I've been able to get in today working with Node :)

**Link to work:** [to be posted: express apps](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Day 32: April 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Happy Friday! Today I continued learning Express and how to use partials and public assets in an application. Partials can also be called layouts and can be reusable html such as the header and footer for webpages. Public assets can be things like stylesheets and scripts. Just have to make sure to include them.

**Thoughts:** Still digging learning express. Going to continue working on freeCodeCamp algorithm challenges for JavaScript as well :)
